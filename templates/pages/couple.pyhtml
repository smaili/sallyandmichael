                      I knew I loved him when we were in San Jos√© for Christmas
                      and New Year's. Though we were both away from our family and friends, we had
                      the best time together and I remember looking at him and knowing
                      that I wanted to be with him for the rest of my life. When
                      he proposed, the answer was easy, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;

                      The first time we went out, I knew there was something
                      special about her. Not only because she could make me
                      laugh, but her gentle personality and beautiful smile
                      blew me away. A few months into our relationship, I remember
                      waking up from a nap and looking at her still asleep. I
                      thought to myself, &ldquo;She is the girl of my dreams.&rdquo;
